"","water system [name] has a fluoride concentration of [insert value] mg/L. 
Dental fluorosis may result in a brown staining and/or pitting of the 
permanent teeth.  This problem occurs only in developing teeth, before 
they erupt from the gums.  Children under nine should be provided with 
alternative sources of drinking water or water that has been treated to 
remove the fluoride to avoid the possibility of staining and pitting of their 
permanent teeth.  You may also want to contact your dentist about 
proper use by young children of fluoride-containing products.  Older 
children and adults may safely drink the water. 
Drinking water containing more than 4 mg/L of fluoride can increase 
your risk of developing bone disease. 
For more information, please call [water system contact name] of [water 
system name] at [phone number].  Some home water treatment units 
are also available to remove fluoride from drinking water.  To learn 
more about available home water treatment units, you may call the 
State Board’s Residential Water Treatment Device Registration Unit at 
(916) 449-5600."
"Lead","Infants and children who drink water containing lead in excess of the 
action level may experience delays in their physical or mental 
development. Children may show slight deficits in attention span and 
learning abilities. Adults who drink this water over many years may 
develop kidney problems or high blood pressure."
"Mercury","Some people who drink water containing mercury in excess of the MCL 
over many years may experience mental disturbances, or impaired 
physical coordination, speech and hearing."
"Nickel","Some people who drink water containing nickel in excess of the MCL 
over many years may experience liver and heart effects."
"Nitrate","Infants below the age of six months who drink water containing nitrate 
in excess of the MCL may quickly become seriously ill and, if untreated, 
may die because high nitrate levels can interfere with the capacity of 
the infant’s blood to carry oxygen. Symptoms include shortness of 
breath and blueness of the skin.  High nitrate levels may also affect the 
oxygen-carrying ability of the blood of pregnant women."
"Nitrite","Infants below the age of six months who drink water containing nitrite in 
excess of the MCL may become seriously ill and, if untreated, may die. 
Symptoms include shortness of breath and blueness of the skin."
"Perchlorate","Perchlorate has been shown to interfere with uptake of iodide by the 
thyroid gland, and to thereby reduce the production of thyroid 
hormones, leading to adverse effects associated with inadequate 
hormone levels.  Thyroid hormones are needed for normal prenatal 
growth and development of the fetus, as well as for normal growth and 
development in the infant and child.  In adults, thyroid hormones are 
needed for normal metabolism and mental function."
