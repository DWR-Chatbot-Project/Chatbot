E. coli are bacteria whose presence indicates that the water 
may be contaminated with human or animal wastes.  Human 
pathogens in these wastes can cause short-term effects, such 
as diarrhea, cramps, nausea, headaches, or other symptoms. 
They may pose a greater health risk for infants, young 
children, the elderly, and people with severely compromised 
immune systems.  We violated the standard for E. coli, 
indicating the need to look for potential problems in water 
treatment or distribution.  When this occurs, we are required 
to conduct a detailed assessment to identify problems and to 
correct any problems that are found. 
or a public notice, the water system shall use the following 
applicable sentences:  
e failed to conduct the required assessment. 
e failed to correct all identified sanitary defects that were 
found during the assessment."

"Turbidity","Turbidity has no health effects. However, high levels of 
turbidity can interfere with disinfection and provide a medium 
for microbial growth. Turbidity may indicate the presence of 
disease-causing organisms. These organisms include 
bacteria, viruses, and parasites that can cause symptoms 
such as nausea, cramps, diarrhea, and associated 
headaches."
