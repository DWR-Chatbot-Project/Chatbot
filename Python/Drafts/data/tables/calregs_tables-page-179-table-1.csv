"Contaminant","Health Effects Language"
"Total Coliform","Coliforms are bacteria that are naturally present in the 
environment and are used as an indicator that other, 
potentially-harmful, bacteria may be present.  
Coliforms were found in more samples than allowed 
and this was a warning of potential problems."
"Fecal Coliform","Fecal coliforms are bacteria whose presence indicates 
that the water may be contaminated with human or 
animal wastes.  Microbes in these wastes can cause 
short-term effects, such as diarrhea, cramps, nausea, 
headaches, or other symptoms.  They may pose a 
special health risk for infants, young children, some of 
the elderly, and people with severely compromised 
immune systems."
"E. coli","E. coli are bacteria whose presence indicates that the 
water may be contaminated with human or animal 
wastes.  Human pathogens in these wastes can cause 
short-term effects, such as diarrhea, cramps, nausea, 
headaches, or other symptoms.  They may pose a 
greater health risk for infants, young children, some of 
the elderly, and people with severely-compromised 
immune systems."
