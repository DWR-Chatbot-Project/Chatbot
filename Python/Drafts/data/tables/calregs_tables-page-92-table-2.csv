"Type of Water System","Sampling Requirement"
"Public water system 
using only a single 
groundwater (not 
GWUDI) well, serving 
1,000 or fewer persons, 
and required to conduct 
triggered source water 
monitoring under 40 
CFR 141.402(a), which 
is incorporated by 
reference under Section 
64430","The system may propose repeat sampling locations 
to the State Board that differentiate potential source 
water and distribution system contamination (e.g., 
by sampling at entry points to the distribution 
system).  The system may submit a request to the 
State Board to take one of its repeat samples at the 
monitoring location required for triggered source 
water monitoring (dual purpose sampling) under 40 
CFR 141.402(a), which is incorporated by reference 
under Section 64430, if the system demonstrates to 
the State Board that the bacteriological sample 
siting plan remains representative of water quality in 
the distribution system.  If approved by the State 
Board, the system may use that sample result to 
meet the monitoring requirements in both 40 CFR 
141.402(a), which is incorporated by reference 
under Section 64430, and this section."
