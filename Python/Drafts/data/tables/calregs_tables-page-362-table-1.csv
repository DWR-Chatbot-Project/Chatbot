achieve a monthly mean reduction of 0.5-log or greater in turbidity 
or alternative State-approved performance criteria. To be eligible, 
basins must be operated continuously with coagulant addition and 
all plant flow must pass through basins. Specific criteria are in

"(5) Bank filtration","0.5-log credit for 25-foot setback; 1.0-log credit for 50-foot 
setback; aquifer must be unconsolidated sand containing at least 
10 percent fines; average turbidity in wells must be less than 1 
NTU. Systems using wells followed by filtration when conducting 
source water monitoring must sample the well to determine bin 
classification and are not eligible for additional credit. Specific 
criteria are in § 141.717(c)."

"(6) Combined filter 
performance","0.5-log credit for combined filter effluent turbidity less than or

month. Specific criteria are in § 141.718(a)."
"(7) Individual filter 
performance","0.5-log credit (in addition to 0.5-log combined filter performance 
credit) if individual filter effluent turbidity is less than or equal to 
0.15 NTU in at least 95 percent of samples each month in each 
filter and is never greater than 0.3 NTU in two consecutive 
measurements in any filter. Specific criteria are in § 141.718(b)."
