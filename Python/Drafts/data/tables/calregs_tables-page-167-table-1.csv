people may experience anemia."
"Chlorine dioxide (2 
consecutive daily 
samples at the entry 
point to the 
distribution system 
that are greater than 
the MRDL)","Some infants and young children who drink water containing 
chlorine dioxide in excess of the MRDL could experience 
nervous system effects.  Similar effects may occur in fetuses of 
pregnant women who drink water containing chlorine dioxide in 
excess of the MRDL.  Some people may experience anemia. 
Add for public notification only:  The chlorine dioxide violations 
reported today are the result of exceedances at the treatment 
facility only, not within the distribution system that delivers water 
to consumers.  Continued compliance with chlorine dioxide 
levels within the distribution system minimizes the potential risk 
of these violations to consumers."
"Chlorine dioxide (one 
or more distribution 
system samples are 
above the MRDL)","Some infants and young children who drink water containing 
chlorine dioxide in excess of the MRDL could experience 
nervous system effects.  Similar effects may occur in fetuses of 
pregnant women who drink water containing chlorine dioxide in 
excess of the MRDL.  Some people may experience anemia. 
Add for public notification only:  The chlorine dioxide violations 
reported today include exceedances of the State standard 
within the distribution system that delivers water to consumers.  
These violations may harm human health based on short-term 
exposures.  Certain groups, including fetuses, infants, and 
young children, may be especially susceptible to nervous 
system effects from excessive chlorine dioxide exposure."
"Control of DBP 
precursors (TOC)","Total organic carbon (TOC) has no health effects.  However, 
total organic carbon provides a medium for the formation of 
disinfection byproducts.  These byproducts include 
trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs).  Drinking 
water containing these byproducts in excess of the MCL may 
lead to adverse health effects, liver or kidney problems, or 
nervous system effects, and may lead to an increased risk of 
getting cancer."
