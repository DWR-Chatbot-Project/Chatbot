Coliforms are bacteria that are naturally present in the 
environment and are used as an indicator that other, 
potentially harmful, waterborne pathogens may be present or 
that a potential pathway exists through which contamination

required to conduct assessment(s) to identify problems and to 
correct any problems that were found.
