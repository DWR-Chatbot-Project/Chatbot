The arsenic standard balances the current understanding of arsenic's possible health effects against the costs of removing arsenic from drinking water. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency continues to research the health effects of low levels of arsenic, which is a mineral known to cause cancer in humans at high concentrations and is linked to other health effects such as skin damage and circulatory problems.”\n(b) A system that detects nitrate at levels above 5 mg/L (as nitrogen), but below the MCL, shall include the following in its Consumer Confidence Report: “Nitrate in drinking water at levels above 10 mg/L is a health risk for infants of less than six months of age. Such nitrate levels in drinking water can interfere with the capacity of the infant's blood to carry oxygen, resulting in a serious illness; symptoms include shortness of breath and blueness of the skin. Nitrate levels above 10 mg/L may also affect the ability of the blood to carry oxygen in other individuals, such as pregnant women and those with certain specific enzyme deficiencies. If you are caring for an infant, or you are pregnant, you should ask advice from your health care provider.” If a system cannot demonstrate to the State Board with at least five years of the most current monitoring data that its nitrate levels are stable, it shall also add the following language to the preceding statement on nitrate: “Nitrate levels may rise quickly for short periods of time because of rainfall or agricultural activity.”\n(c) A system that detects lead above the action level in more than 5%, and up to and including 10%, of sites sampled, shall include the following in its Consumer Confidence Report: “Infants and young children are typically more vulnerable to lead in drinking water than the general population. It is possible that lead levels at your home may be higher than at other homes in the community as a result of materials used in your home's plumbing. If you are concerned about elevated lead levels in your home's water, you may wish to have your water tested and/or flush your tap for 30 seconds to 2 minutes before using tap water.

If the running annual average or the average concentration of the initial finding, confirmation sample(s), and six subsequent monthly samples exceeds the MCL shown in table 64444-A, the water system shall be deemed to be in violation of section 64444.\n(B) Water systems serving 3,300 persons or less shall sample quarterly for a minimum of one year and shall submit the results to the State Board as specified in section 64469. If the running annual average concentration does not exceed the MCL in table 64444-A, the water supplier may reduce the sampling frequency to once every year during the quarter that previously yielded the highest analytical result. Quarterly monitoring shall resume if any reduced frequency sample result exceeds the MCL. If the running annual average concentration exceeds the MCL in table 64444-A, the water system shall be deemed to be in violation of section 64444.\n(C) If any sample would cause the running annual average to exceed the MCL, the water system is immediately in violation. If a system takes more than one sample in a quarter, the average of all the results for that quarter shall be used when calculating the running annual average. If a system fails to complete four consecutive quarters of monitoring, the running annual average shall be based on an average of the available data.\n(6) If any resample, other than those taken in accordance with paragraph (5), of a water sampling site shows that the concentration of any organic chemical exceeds a MCL shown in table 64444-A, the water supplier shall proceed in accordance with paragraphs (1) and (4), or paragraph (5).\n(7) If an organic chemical is detected and the concentration exceeds ten times the MCL, the water supplier shall notify the State Board within 48 hours of the receipt of the results and the contaminated site shall be resampled within 48 hours to confirm the result. The water supplier shall notify the State Board of the result of the confirmation sample(s) within 24 hours of the receipt of the confirmation result(s).\n(A) If the average concentration of the original and confirmation sample(s) is less than or equal to ten times the MCL, the water supplier shall proceed in accordance with paragraph (5).\n(B) If the average concentration of the original and confirmation samples exceeds ten times the MCL, use of the contaminated water source shall immediately be discontinued, if directed by the State Board. Such a water source shall not be returned to service without written approval from the State Board.\n"

  "title": "§ 64445. Initial Sampling--Organic Chemicals.",
  "paragraphText": "(a) Each community and nontransient-noncommunity water system shall collect four quarterly samples during the year designated by the State Board of each compliance period beginning with the compliance period starting January 1, 1993, from each water source at a site prior to any treatment and test for all applicable organic chemicals listed in Table 64444-A. The State Board will designate the year based on historical monitoring frequency and laboratory capacity. For surface sources, the samples shall be taken at each water intake. For groundwater sources, the samples shall be taken at each well head. Where multiple intakes or wells draw from the same water supply, the State Board will consider sampling of representative sources as a means of complying with this section. Selection of representative sources shall be based on evidence which includes a hydrogeological survey and sampling results. Wells shall be allowed to flow for a minimum of 15 minutes before sampling to insure that the samples reflect the water quality of the source. In place of water source samples, a supplier may collect samples at sites located at the entry points to the distribution system. The samples shall be representative of each source after treatment. The system shall collect each sample at the same sampling site, unless a change is approved by the State Board.\n(b) For any organic chemical added to Table 64444-A, the water system shall initiate the quarterly monitoring for that chemical in January of the calendar year after the effective date of the MCL.\n(c) A water system may request approval from the State Board to composite samples from up to five sampling sites, provided that the number of the sites to be composited is less than the ratio of the MCL to the DLR in Section 64445.1. Approval will be based on a review of three years of historical data, well construction and aquifer information for groundwater, and intake location, similarity of sources, and watershed characteristics for surface water. Compositing shall be done in the laboratory and analyses shall be conducted within 14 days of sample collection.\n(1) Systems serving more than 3,300 persons shall composite only from sampling sites within a single system. Systems serving 3,300 persons or less may composite among different systems up to the 5-sample limit.\n(2) If any organic chemical is detected in the composite sample, a follow-up sample shall be analyzed within 14 days from each sampling site included in the composite for the contaminants which were detected. The water supplier shall report the results to the State Board within 14 days of the follow-up sample collection. If available, duplicates of the original sample taken from each sampling site used in the composite may be used instead of resampling.\n(d) A water system may apply to the State Board for a monitoring waiver for one or more of the organic chemicals on Table 64444-A in accordance with the following:\n(1) A source may be eligible for a waiver if it can be documented that the chemical has not been previously used, manufactured, transported, stored, or disposed of within the watershed or zone of influence and, therefore, that the source can be designated nonvulnerable.\n(2) If previous use of the chemical locally is unknown or the chemical is known to have been used previously and the source cannot be designated nonvulnerable pursuant to Paragraph (d)(1), it may still be eligible for a waiver based on a review related to susceptibility to contamination. The application to the State Board for a waiver based on susceptibility shall include the following:\n(A) Previous monitoring results;\n(B) user population characteristics;\n(C) proximity to sources of contamination;\n(D) surrounding land uses;\n(E) degree of protection of the water source;\n(F) environmental persistence and transport of the chemical in water, soil and air;\n(G) elevated nitrate levels at the water supply source; and\n(H) historical system operation and maintenance data including previous State Board inspection results.\n(3) To apply for a monitoring waiver for VOCs, the water system shall have completed the initial four quarters of monitoring pursuant to subsection (a) or three consecutive years of monitoring with no VOCs detected. If granted a waiver for VOC monitoring, a system using groundwater shall collect a minimum of one sample from every sampling site every six years and a system using surface water shall not be required to monitor for the term of the waiver. The term of a VOC waiver shall not exceed three years.\n(4) To obtain a monitoring waiver for one or more of the SOCs, the water system may apply before doing the initial round of monitoring or shall have completed three consecutive years of annual monitoring with no detection of the SOC(s) listed. If the system is granted a waiver for monitoring for one or more SOC(s), no monitoring for the waived SOC(s) shall be required for the term of the waiver, which shall not exceed three years.\n(e) For water sources designated by a water supplier as standby sources, the water supplier shall sample each source for any organic chemical added to Table 64444-A once within the three-year period beginning in January of the calendar year after the effective date of the MCL.\n(f) Water quality data collected prior to January 1, 1988, for VOCs, or January 1, 1990, for SOCs, and/or data collected in a manner inconsistent with this section shall not be used in the determination of compliance with the monitoring requirements for organic chemicals.\n(g) MTBE data (i.e., a single sample) collected in a manner consistent with this section after January 1, 1998 in which no MTBE is detected, along with a designation of nonvulnerability pursuant to subsection (d), may be used to satisfy the initial monitoring requirements in subsection (a). If the requirements are satisfied in this way by a water system, the system shall begin annual monitoring pursuant to Section 64445.1(b)(1).\n(h) Water quality data collected in compliance with the monitoring requirements of this section by a wholesaler agency providing water to a public water system shall be acceptable for use by that system for compliance with the monitoring requirements of this section.\n(i) Results obtained from groundwater monitoring performed for an organic chemical in accordance with this section and not more than two calendar years prior to the effective date of a regulation establishing the MCL for that organic chemical may be substituted to partially satisfy the initial monitoring requirements required by this section for that organic chemical. Requests to substitute groundwater monitoring results shall be made in accordance with the following:\n1. Requests shall be made in writing by the water system to the State Board; and\n2. If the State Board approves the request then results from a given calendar quarter will only be eligible to substitute for a single required initial monitoring result during that same quarter of initial monitoring. (e.g. the second quarter of 2016 may be substituted for the second quarter of 2018).\n3. No more than three of the four quarterly samples as required by section 64445(a) or (b) may be substituted.\n"

  "title": "§ 64668.30. SWSAP Augmented Reservoir Requirements.",
  "paragraphText": "(a) The SWSAP PWS shall ensure that prior to augmentation of a surface water reservoir by a SWSAP, the surface water reservoir to be used as an augmented reservoir was in operation as an approved surface water supply pursuant to this Chapter for a period of time sufficient to establish a baseline record of the surface water reservoir's raw water quality (including, but not limited to, the monitoring required pursuant to section 60320.326, Chapter 3), and treated drinking water quality. A surface water reservoir shall have been operating as an approved surface water source for at least five years prior to receiving recycled municipal wastewater from a SWSAP, unless approved otherwise in writing by the State Board, but in no case less than two years.\n(b) The SWSAP PWS shall ensure that a surface water reservoir used as an augmented reservoir has a minimum theoretical retention time of no less than that which has been approved by the State Board. Monthly, the SWSAP PWS shall calculate and record the theoretical retention time. The theoretical retention time shall be the value (in units of days) resulting from dividing the volume of water in the surface water reservoir at the end of each month, by the total outflow from the surface water reservoir during the corresponding month. The total outflow shall include, but not be limited to, all outflows and withdrawals from the surface water reservoir. An initial approved minimum theoretical retention time may be no less than 180 days.\n(1) If a month's theoretical retention time is determined to be less than the SWSAP PWS's approved theoretical retention time, the SWSAP PWS shall, by the end of the subsequent month, submit a report to the State Board and Regional Board describing the corrective actions to be taken to ensure future theoretical retention times will be no less than the approved theoretical retention time.\n(2) A SWSAP PWS may apply to the State Board, for written approval, for a reduced on-going alternative minimum theoretical retention time of less than 180 days, but no less than 60 days. The SWSAP PWS's application shall include all information requested by the State Board for its consideration of a proposed alternative minimum theoretical retention time, including the following:\n(A) Evidence that the SWSAP PWS and SWSAP WRA have reliably and consistently met the requirements of this Article and Article 5.3, Chapter 3, under varying operating conditions;\n(B) At the proposed alternative minimum theoretical retention time, the maximum anticipated recycled municipal wastewater flow to the surface water reservoir, the total anticipated outflows from the reservoir, and the total available flows of approved reservoir sources of supply;\n(C) The maximum percent, by volume, of recycled municipal wastewater that will be delivered to the surface water reservoir during any 24-hour period, in accordance with subsection (c), at the proposed alternative minimum theoretical retention time;\n(D) A description of total proposed treatment and total log\n(E) The ability to adequately respond to potential SWSAP treatment failures in a timely manner, such that there is no interruption of drinking water, meeting all applicable standards, supplied to customers; and\n(F) A demonstration that the alternative minimum theoretical retention time provides, based on information provided pursuant to subsection (b)(2), an equivalent or better level of protection of public health than otherwise required pursuant to this Article and Article 5.3, Chapter 3. If required by the State Board, the SWSAP PWS's demonstration shall include a review by an independent scientific advisory panel approved by the State Board.\n(c) Prior to augmentation and whenever requested to do so by the State Board based on information that previous tracer studies or hydrodynamic modeling may not accurately reflect current conditions, the SWSAP PWS shall demonstrate to the State Board, utilizing tracer studies and hydrodynamic modeling, that at all times under all operating conditions, the volume of water withdrawn from the augmented reservoir to be ultimately supplied for human consumption contains no more than:\n(1) one percent, by volume, of recycled municipal wastewater that was delivered to the surface water reservoir during any 24-hour period, or\n(2) ten percent, by volume, of recycled municipal wastewater that was delivered to the surface water reservoir during any 24-hour period, with the recycled municipal wastewater delivered by the SWSAP WRA having been subjected to additional treatment producing no less than a 1-log\n(A) The additional treatment need not be a unique type of process from other treatment processes utilized by the SWSAP WRA to meet the requirements of section 60320.308.\n(B) The SWSAP PWS, in consultation with the SWSAP WRA, shall obtain the additional treatment process information necessary for demonstrating that the requirements of subsection (c)(2) of this section, and section 60320.308(a)(2), will be met.\n(d) To verify that the requirements of subsection (c) are being met, within the first six months of operation, under hydraulic conditions representative of normal SWSAP operations, the SWSAP PWS shall initiate a tracer study utilizing an added tracer. The results of the tracer study shall be used to validate the hydrodynamic modeling required in subsection (c). Prior to performing the tracer study, the SWSAP PWS shall submit a tracer study protocol for State Board review and written approval. The SWSAP PWS shall perform the verification required by this subsection whenever requested by the State Board.\n(e) Notwithstanding a change in operation allowed pursuant to the SWSAP PWS's domestic water supply permit, prior to initiating a change in operation, including physical changes to the surface water reservoir, that may impact the hydraulic characterization utilized to determine compliance with the requirements of this section, the SWSAP PWS shall notify the State Board and:\n(1) demonstrate that the hydraulic characterization used to comply with this section remains valid under the changed operation, or\n(2) if requested by the State Board, demonstrate compliance pursuant to this section under the new hydraulic conditions.\n(f) Unless directed otherwise by the State Board, a SWSAP PWS shall utilize an independent scientific advisory panel to meet the requirements of this section pertaining to the hydraulic characterization of the reservoir, including tracer study verifications and hydraulic modeling used to demonstrate compliance with subsection (c).\n(g) Prior to augmentation of a surface water reservoir using a SWSAP, a SWSAP PWS shall submit a plan, for State Board review and approval, describing the actions the SWSAP PWS will take to assess and address potential impacts resulting from the introduction of advanced treated water into the SWSAP PWS's surface water treatment plant and, indirectly, into the drinking water distribution system. At a minimum, the plan shall address:\n(1) maintaining chemical and microbial stability in the drinking water distribution system as the drinking water quality changes with anticipated increasing fractions of advanced treated water;\n(2) maintaining treatment effectiveness throughout the surface water treatment plant as the source water quality changes with anticipated increasing fractions of advanced treated water in the reservoir;\n(3) assessments to be performed prior to and during operation of the SWSAP with respect to paragraphs (1) and (2); and\n(4) assessment outcomes of which the SWSAP PWS will notify the State Board.\n"

  "paragraphText": "(a) During the first year of monitoring for disinfection byproducts under sections 64534.2(a), (b), and (c), the system shall comply with paragraphs (1) through (3). During the first year of monitoring for TTHM and HAA5 under section 64534.2(d), the system shall comply with paragraphs (1) through (3) at each monitoring location.\n(1) The sum of the first quarter's results, divided by four, shall not exceed the MCLs specified in section 64533.\n(2) The sum of the first and second quarter's results, divided by four, shall not exceed the MCLs specified in section 64533.\n(3) The sum of the first, second, and third quarter's results, divided by four, shall not exceed the MCLs specified in section 64533.\n(b) TTHM and HAA5 MCL compliance, as monitored pursuant to section 64534.2(a), shall be determined as follows:\n(1) For systems monitoring quarterly, the running annual arithmetic average, computed quarterly, of quarterly arithmetic averages of all samples collected pursuant to section 64534.2(a) shall not exceed the MCLs specified in section 64533;\n(2) For systems monitoring less frequently than quarterly, the average of samples collected that calendar year pursuant to section 64534.2(a) shall not exceed the MCLs specified in section 64533. If the average of the samples collected under section 64534.2(a) exceeds the MCL, the system shall increase monitoring to once per quarter per treatment plant. Compliance with the MCL shall then be determined by the average of the sample that triggered the quarterly monitoring and the following three quarters of monitoring, unless the result of fewer than four quarters of monitoring will cause the running annual average to exceed the MCL, in which case the system is in violation immediately. After monitoring quarterly for four consecutive quarters (including the quarter that triggered the quarterly monitoring), and until such time as monitoring returns to routine monitoring pursuant to section 64534.2(a)(3), compliance shall be determined pursuant to paragraph (1);\n(3) If the running annual arithmetic average of quarterly averages covering any consecutive four-quarter period exceeds the MCL, the system is in violation of the MCL and shall notify the public pursuant to sections 64463, 64463.4, and 64465, including language in appendix 64465-G, in addition to reporting to the State Board pursuant to sections 64537 through 64537.6; and\n(4) If a public water system fails to complete four consecutive quarters of monitoring, compliance with the MCL for the last four-quarter compliance period shall be based on an average of the available data.\n(c) Compliance for bromate shall be based on a running annual arithmetic average, computed quarterly, of monthly samples (or, for months in which the system takes more than one sample, the average of all samples taken during the month) collected by the system as prescribed by section 64534.2(c). If the average of samples covering any consecutive four-quarter period exceeds the MCL, the system is in violation of the MCL and shall notify the public pursuant to sections 64463, 64463.4, and 64465, including language in appendix 64465-G, in addition to reporting to the State Board pursuant to sections 64537 through 64537.6. \n(d) Compliance for chlorite shall be based on the results of samples collected by the system pursuant to section 64534.2(b).\n(1) If any daily sample taken at the entrance to the distribution system exceeds the chlorite MCL and one (or more) of the three samples taken in the distribution system pursuant to section 64534.2(b)(1) exceeds the chlorite MCL, the system is in violation of the MCL and shall take immediate corrective action to reduce the concentration of chlorite to a level below the MCL. The system shall notify the State Board within 48 hours of the determination and notify the public pursuant to the procedures for acute health risks in sections 64463, 64463.1, and 64465, including language in appendix 64465-G, in addition to reporting to the State Board pursuant to sections 64537 through 64537.6. Failure to take samples in the distribution system the day following an exceedance of the chlorite MCL at the entrance to the distribution system is also an MCL violation and the system shall notify and report as described in this paragraph;\n(2) If the average of an individual sample from the three-sample set taken pursuant to section 64534.2(b)(2) and its confirmation sample taken pursuant to section 64634.2(b)(4) exceeds the chlorite MCL, the system is in violation of the MCL and shall take the corrective action and notify and report as described in paragraph (1). If the average of the individual sample and its confirmation does not exceed the MCL, the system shall inform the State Board of the results within seven days from receipt of the original analysis. Failure to take a confirmation sample pursuant to section 64534.2(b)(4) is also an MCL violation and the system shall notify and report as described in paragraph (1); and\n(3) If any two consecutive daily samples taken at the entrance to the distribution system exceed the chlorite MCL and all distribution system samples taken pursuant to section 64534.2(b)(1) are less than or equal to the chlorite MCL, the system is in violation of the MCL and shall take corrective action to reduce the concentration of chlorite to a level below the MCL at the point of sampling. The system shall notify the public pursuant to the procedures for nonacute health risks in sections 64463, 64463.4, and 64465, including the language in appendix 64465-G, in addition to reporting to the State Board pursuant to sections 64537 through 64537.6. Failure to monitor at the entrance to the distribution system the day following an exceedance of the chlorite MCL at the entrance to the distribution system is also an MCL violation and the system shall notify and report as described in this paragraph.\n(e) TTHM and HAA5 MCL compliance, as monitored pursuant to section 64534.2(d), shall be determined as follows:\n(1) For systems monitoring quarterly, each locational running annual average (LRAA), computed quarterly, shall not exceed the MCLs specified in section 64533;\n(2) For systems monitoring annually or less frequently, each sample collected shall not exceed the MCLs specified in section 64533. If no sample exceeds the MCL, the sample result for each monitoring location shall be considered the LRAA for the monitoring location. If any sample exceeds the MCL, systems shall increase monitoring pursuant to section 64534.2(d)(5). Compliance with the MCL shall then be determined by the average of the sample that triggered the quarterly monitoring and the following three quarters of monitoring, unless the result of fewer than four quarters of monitoring will cause the LRAA to exceed the MCL, in which case the system is in violation immediately. \n(3) If a system fails to complete four consecutive quarters of monitoring, compliance with the MCL for the last four-quarter compliance period shall be based on an average of the available data. If more than one sample per quarter is taken at a monitoring location, all the samples taken in the quarter at that monitoring location shall be averaged to determine a quarterly average to be used in the LRAA calculation; and\n(4) If the LRAA exceeds the MCL, calculated based on four consecutive quarters of monitoring (or the LRAA calculated based on fewer than four quarters of data if the MCL would be exceeded regardless of the monitoring results of subsequent quarters), the system is in violation of the MCL and shall notify the public pursuant to sections 64463, 64463.4, and 64465, including the language in appendix 64465-G, in addition to reporting to the State Board pursuant to sections 64537 through 64537.6.\n"

If the State Board approves the Step 2 removal requirements pursuant to subsection (d), and the system conducted monthly TOC monitoring beginning one year prior to the compliance date specified in section 64530, the Step 2 removal requirements will be retroactive to the compliance date for the purposes of determining compliance.\n(d) Applications made to the State Board by systems using enhanced coagulation for approval of Step 2 removal requirements under subsection (c) shall include, as a minimum, results of bench-scale or pilot-scale testing conducted under paragraph (1) of this subsection that were used to determine the alternate enhanced coagulation level.\nTable 64536.2-B Enhanced Coagulation Step 2 Target pH\nAlkalinity  mg/L as CaCO,3,Target pH\n \n0-60,5.5\n>60-120,6.3\n>120-240,7.0\n>240,7.5\n(1) Alternate enhanced coagulation level is defined as coagulation at a coagulant dose and pH as determined by the method described in paragraphs (1) through (4) such that an incremental addition of 10 mg/L of alum (or equivalent addition of iron coagulant) results in a TOC removal of <0.3 mg/L. The percent removal of TOC at this point on the “TOC removal versus coagulant dose” curve is then defined as the Step 2 removal requirement for the system. Once approved by the State Board, this Step 2 removal requirement supersedes the minimum TOC removal required by section 64536.2(b). This requirement shall be effective until such time as the State Board approves a new value based on the results of a new bench-scale or pilot-scale test.\n(2) Bench-scale or pilot-scale testing of enhanced coagulation shall be conducted by using representative water samples and adding 10 mg/L increments of alum (or equivalent addition of iron coagulant) until the pH is reduced to a level less than or equal to the enhanced coagulation Step 2 target pH shown in table 64536.2-B.\nTable 64536.2-B Enhanced Coagulation Step 2 Target pH\nAlkalinity  mg/L as CaCO,3,Target pH\n \n0-60,5.5\n>60-120,6.3\n>120-240,7.0\n>240,7.5\n(3) For waters with alkalinities of less than 60 mg/L for which the addition of small amounts of alum (or equivalent addition of iron coagulant) drives the pH below 5.5 before significant TOC removal occurs, the system shall add necessary chemicals to maintain the pH between 5.3 and 5.7 in samples until the TOC removal of 0.3 mg/L per 10 mg/L alum added (or equivalent addition of iron coagulant) is reached.\n(4) If the TOC removal is consistently less than 0.3 mg/L of TOC per 10 mg/L of incremental alum dose at all dosages of alum (or equivalent addition of iron coagulant), the system is eligible to apply for a waiver of enhanced coagulation requirements.

Other repeat samples shall be collected within five service connections upstream or downstream of the original site. At least one sample shall be from upstream and one from downstream unless there is no upstream and/or downstream service connection. If a total coliform-positive sample is at the end of the distribution system, or one service connection away from the end of the distribution system, the system shall still take all required repeat samples. The system may submit a request to the State Board to use an alternative sampling location in lieu of the requirement to collect at least one repeat sample upstream or downstream of the original sampling site. Except as provided in Table 64424-B, a system required to conduct triggered source water monitoring under 40 CFR 141.402(a), which is incorporated by reference under Section 64430, shall take groundwater (not GWUDI) source sample(s) in addition to repeat samples required under this section. If monitoring pursuant to Table 64424-B and in violation of the \nTable 64424-B  Dual Purpose Sampling Locations(a) If a routine sample is total coliform-positive, a public water system shall collect a repeat sample set as described in paragraph (1) within 24 hours of being notified of the positive result.

The system may elect to specify either alternative fixed locations or criteria for selecting repeat sampling sites on a situational basis in a standard operating procedure (SOP) in its bacteriological sample siting plan. The system shall design its SOP to focus the repeat samples at locations that best verify and determine the extent of potential contamination of the distribution system area based on specific situations.\n\nPublic water system using only a single groundwater (not GWUDI) well, serving 1,000 or fewer persons, and required to conduct triggered source water monitoring under 40 CFR 141.402(a), which is incorporated by reference under Section 64430,The system may propose repeat sampling locations to the State Board that differentiate potential source water and distribution system contamination (e.g., by sampling at entry points to the distribution system). The system may submit a request to the State Board to take one of its repeat samples at the monitoring location required for triggered source water monitoring (dual purpose sampling) under 40 CFR 141.402(a), which is incorporated by reference under Section 64430, if the system demonstrates to the State Board that the bacteriological sample siting plan remains representative of water quality in the distribution system. If approved by the State Board, the system may use that sample result to meet the monitoring requirements in both 40 CFR 141.402(a), which is incorporated by reference under Section 64430, and this section.\n\n \nA repeat sample taken at the monitoring location required for triggered source water monitoring is ,E. coli,-positive,The system shall comply with 40 CFR 141.402(a)(3), which is incorporated by reference under Section 64430. If the system takes more than one repeat sample at the monitoring location required for triggered source water monitoring, the system may reduce the number of additional source water samples required under 40 CFR 141.402(a)(3), which is incorporated by reference under Section 64430, by the number of repeat samples taken at that location that were not ,E. coli,-positive.\n \n \nA system takes more than one repeat sample at the monitoring location required for triggered source water monitoring and more than one repeat sample is ,E. coli,-positive,The system shall comply with 40 CFR 141.403(a)(1), which is incorporated by reference under Section 64430.\n \nAll repeat samples taken at the monitoring location required for triggered source water monitoring are ,E. coli,-negative and a repeat sample taken at a monitoring location other than the one required for triggered source water monitoring is ,E. coli,-positive,The system is not required to comply with 40 CFR 141.402(a)(3), which is incorporated by reference under Section 64430.\n(c) If one or more samples in the repeat sample set is total coliform-positive, a public water system shall collect and have analyzed an additional set of repeat samples as specified in subsections (a) and (b). The system shall repeat this process until either no total coliforms are detected in one complete repeat sample set or the system determines that a coliform treatment technique trigger specified in Section 64426.7 has been exceeded as a result of a repeat sample being total coliform-positive and notifies the State Board by the end of the day on which this is determined. If a treatment technique trigger identified in Section 64426.7 is exceeded as a result of a routine sample being total coliform-positive, the system is required to conduct only one round of repeat monitoring for each total coliform-positive routine sample.\n(d) A public water system in violation of the repeat sample monitoring requirements of this section shall notify the State Board within 10 days after it learns of the violation and notify the public pursuant to Sections 64463, 64463.7, and 64465.\n(e) A public water system in violation of the reporting requirement in subsection (d) to notify the State Board shall notify the public pursuant to Sections 64463, 64463.7, and 64465.\n"

  "paragraphText": "(a) All public water systems shall monitor to determine compliance with the nitrate and nitrite MCLs in table 64431-A, pursuant to subsections (d) through (f) and section 64432.1. All community and nontransient-noncommunity water systems shall monitor to determine compliance with the perchlorate MCL, pursuant to subsections (d), (e), and (\n(b) Unless directed otherwise by the State Board, each community and nontransient-noncommunity water system shall initiate monitoring for an inorganic chemical within six months following the effective date of the regulation establishing the MCL for the chemical and the addition of the chemical to table 64431-A.\n(c) Unless more frequent monitoring is required pursuant to this Chapter, the frequency of monitoring for the inorganic chemicals listed in table 64431-A, except for asbestos, nitrate/nitrite, and perchlorate, shall be as follows:\n(1) Each compliance period, all community and nontransient-noncommunity systems using groundwater shall monitor once during the year designated by the State Board. The State Board will designate the year based on historical monitoring frequency and laboratory capacity. All community and nontransient-noncommunity systems using approved surface water shall monitor annually. All systems monitoring at distribution entry points which have combined surface and groundwater sources shall monitor annually.\n(2) Quarterly samples shall be collected and analyzed for any chemical if analyses of such samples indicate a continuous or persistent trend toward higher levels of that chemical, based on an evaluation of previous data.\n(d) For the purposes of sections 64432, 64432.1, 64432.2, and 64432.3, detection shall be defined by the detection limits for purposes of reporting (DLRs) in table 64432-A.\nTable 64432-ADetection Limits for Purposes of Reporting (DLRs) for Regulated Inorganic Chemicals\n\nAluminum,0.05\n ,Antimony,0.006\n ,Arsenic,0.002\n ,Asbestos,0.2\n , ,MFL>10μm,*\n ,Barium,0.1\n ,Beryllium,0.001\n ,Cadmium,0.001\n ,Chromium,0.01\n ,Cyanide,0.1\n ,Fluoride,0.1\n ,Mercury,0.001\n ,Nickel,0.01\n ,Nitrate (as nitrogen),0.4\n ,Nitrite (as nitrogen),0.4\n ,Perchlorate,0.002\n , ,0.001\n , ,(Effective January 1, 2024)\n ,Selenium,0.005\n ,Thallium,0.001\n(e) Samples shall be collected from each water source or a supplier may collect a minimum of one sample at every entry point to the distribution system which is representative of each source after treatment. The system shall collect each sample at the same sampling site, unless a change is approved by the State Board.\n(f) A water system may request approval from the State Board to composite samples from up to five sampling sites, provided that the number of sites to be composited is less than the ratio of the MCL to the DLR. Approval will be based on a review of three years of historical data, well construction and aquifer information for groundwater, and intake location, similarity of sources, and watershed characteristics for surface water. Compositing shall be done in the laboratory.\n(1) Systems serving more than 3,300 persons shall composite only from sampling sites within a single system. Systems serving 3,300 persons or less may composite among different systems up to the 5-sample limit.\n(2) If any inorganic chemical is detected in the composite sample at a level equal to or greater than one fifth of the MCL, a follow-up sample shall be analyzed within 14 days from each sampling site included in the composite for the contaminants which exceeded the one-fifth-MCL level. If available, duplicates of the original sample taken from each sampling site used in the composite may be used instead of resampling; the analytical results shall be reported within 14 days. The water supplier may collect up to two additional samples each from one or more of the sources to confirm the result(s).\n(3) Compliance for each site shall be determined on the basis of the individual follow-up samples, or on the average of the follow-up and confirmation sample(s) if the supplier collects confirmation sample(s) for each detection.\n(g) If the level of any inorganic chemical, except for nitrate, nitrite, nitrate plus nitrite, or perchlorate, exceeds the MCL, the water supplier shall do one of the following:\n(1) Inform the State Board within 48 hours and monitor quarterly beginning in the next quarter after the exceedance occurred; or\n(2) Inform the State Board within seven days from the receipt of the analysis and, as confirmation, collect one additional sample within 14 days from receipt of the analysis. If the average of the two samples collected exceeds the MCL, this information shall be reported to the State Board within 48 hours and the water supplier shall monitor quarterly beginning in the next quarter after the exceedance occurred.\n(h) If the concentration of an inorganic chemical exceeds ten times the MCL, within 48 hours of receipt of the result the water supplier shall notify the State Board and resample as confirmation. The water supplier shall notify the State Board of the result(s) of the confirmation sample(s) within 24 hours of receipt of the confirmation result(s).\n(1) If the average concentration of the original and confirmation sample(s) is less than or equal to ten times the MCL, the water supplier shall monitor quarterly beginning in the quarter following the quarter in which the exceedance occurred.\n(2) If the average concentration of the original and confirmation sample(s) exceeds ten times the MCL, the water supplier shall, if directed by the State Board;\n(A) Immediately discontinue use of the contaminated water source; and\n(B) Not return the source to service without written approval from the State Board.\n(i) Compliance with the MCLs shall be determined by a running annual average; if any one sample would cause the annual average to exceed the MCL, the system is immediately in violation. If a system takes more than one sample in a quarter, the average of all the results for that quarter shall be used when calculating the running annual average. If a system fails to complete four consecutive quarters of monitoring, the running annual average shall be based on an average of the available data.\n(j) If a system using groundwater has collected a minimum of two quarterly samples or a system using approved surface water has collected a minimum of four quarterly samples and the sample results have been below the MCL, the system may apply to the State Board for a reduction in monitoring frequency.\n(k) Water quality data collected prior to January 1, 1990, and/or data collected in a manner inconsistent with this section shall not be used in the determination of compliance with the monitoring requirements for inorganic chemicals.\n(\n(m) A water system may apply to the State Board for a waiver from the monitoring frequencies specified in subsection (c)(1), if the system has conducted at least three rounds of monitoring (three periods for groundwater sources or three years for approved surface water sources) and all previous analytical results are less than the MCL. The water system shall specify the basis for its request. If granted a waiver, a system shall collect a minimum of one sample per source while the waiver is in effect and the term of the waiver shall not exceed one compliance cycle (i.e., nine years).\n(n) A water system may be eligible for a waiver from the monitoring frequencies for cyanide specified in subsection (c)(1) without any prior monitoring if it is able to document that it is not vulnerable to cyanide contamination pursuant to the requirements in section 64445(d)(1) or (d)(2).\n(o) Transient-noncommunity water systems shall monitor for the inorganic chemicals in table 64431-A as follows:\n(1) All sources shall be monitored at least once for fluoride; and\n(2) Surface water sources for parks and other facilities with an average daily population use of more than 1,000 people and/or which are determined to be subject to potential contamination based on a sanitary survey shall be monitored at the same frequency as community water systems.\n"

Within 10 days after the period during which the program was required, the system shall submit a letter to the Department demonstrating that it has delivered the public education materials as required and include a list of all the newspapers, radio stations, television stations, facilities and organizations to which the system delivered the materials during the previous year.\n(1) Except as provided in subsection (b), a community water system shall include the following text in all of the printed materials it distributes through its lead public education program:\n(A) Introduction. The California Department of Health Services (DHS), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and [insert name of water supplier] are concerned about lead in your drinking water. Although most homes have very low levels of lead in their drinking water, some homes in the community have lead levels above the state and federal action level of 15 parts per billion (ppb), or 0.015 milligrams of lead per liter of water (mg/L). Under state and federal law we are required to have a program in place to minimize lead in your drinking water by [insert date when corrosion control will be completed for your system]. This program includes corrosion control treatment, source water treatment, and public education. We are also required to replace the portion of each lead service line that we own if the line contributes lead concentrations of 15 ppb or more after we have completed the comprehensive treatment program. If you have any questions about how we are carrying out the requirements of the lead regulation please give us a call at [insert water system's phone number]. This brochure explains the simple steps you can take to protect you and your family by reducing your exposure to lead in drinking water.\n(B) Health Effects of Lead. Lead is a common metal found throughout the environment in lead-based paint, air, soil, household dust, food, certain types of pottery porcelain and pewter, and water. Lead can pose a significant risk to your health if too much of it enters your body. Lead builds up in the body over many years and can cause damage to the brain, red blood cells and kidneys. The greatest risk is to young children and pregnant women. Amounts of lead that won't hurt adults can slow down normal mental and physical development of growing bodies. In addition, a child at play often comes into contact with sources of lead contamination -- like dirt and dust -- that rarely affect an adult. It is important to wash children's hands and toys often, and to try to make sure they only put food in their mouths.\n(C) Lead In Drinking Water\n1. Lead in drinking water, although rarely the sole cause of lead poisoning, can significantly increase a person's total lead exposure, particularly the exposure of infants who drink baby formulas and concentrated juices that are mixed with water. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that drinking water can make up 20 percent or more of a person's total exposure to lead.\n2. Lead is unusual among drinking water contaminants in that it seldom occurs naturally in water supplies like rivers and lakes. \n3. When water stands in lead pipes or plumbing systems containing lead for several hours or more, the lead may dissolve into your drinking water. This means the first water drawn from the tap in the morning, or later in the afternoon after returning from work or school, can contain fairly high levels of lead.\n(D) Steps You Can Take in the Home to Reduce Exposure to Lead in Drinking Water\n1. Despite our best efforts mentioned earlier to control water corrosivity and remove lead from the water supply, lead levels in some homes or buildings can be high. To find out whether you need to take action in your own home, have your drinking water tested to determine if it contains excessive concentrations of lead. Testing the water is essential because you cannot see, taste, or smell lead in drinking water. Some local laboratories that can provide this service are listed at the end of this booklet. For more information on having your water tested, please call [insert phone number of water system].\n2. If a water test indicates that the drinking water drawn from a tap in your home contains lead above 15 ppb, then you should take the following precautions:\n3. The steps described above will reduce the lead concentrations in your drinking water. However, if a water test indicates that the drinking water coming from your tap contains lead concentrations in excess of 15 ppb after flushing, or after we have completed our actions to minimize lead levels, then you may want to take the following additional measures:\n4. You can consult a variety of sources for additional information. Your family doctor or pediatrician can perform a blood test for lead and provide you with information about the health effects of lead. State and local government agencies that can be contacted include:\n5. The following is a list of some state approved laboratories in your area that you can call to have your water tested for lead. [Insert names and phone numbers of at least two laboratories].\n(2) Except as provided in subsection (b), a nontransient-noncommunity water system shall include either the text in paragraph (a)(1) or the following text, in all of the printed materials it distributes through its lead public education program.\n(A) Introduction. The California Department of Health Services, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and [insert name of water supplier] are concerned about lead in your drinking water. Some drinking water samples taken from this facility have lead levels above the EPA action level of 15 parts per billion (ppb), or 0.015 milligrams of lead per liter of water (mg/L). Under Federal law we are required to have a program in place to minimize lead in your drinking water by [insert date when corrosion control will be completed for your system]. This program includes corrosion control treatment, source water treatment, and public education. We are also required to replace the portion of each lead service line that we own if the line contributes lead concentrations of more than 15 ppb after we have completed the comprehensive treatment program. If you have any questions about how we are carrying out the requirements of the lead regulation please give us a call at [insert water system's phone number]. This brochure explains the simple steps you can take to protect yourself by reducing your exposure to lead in drinking water.\n(B) Health Effects of Lead. Lead is found throughout the environment in lead-based paint, air, soil, household dust, food, certain types of pottery porcelain and pewter, and water. Lead can pose a significant risk to your health if too much of it enters your body. Lead builds up in the body over many years and can cause damage to the brain, red blood cells and kidneys. The greatest risk is to young children and pregnant women. Amounts of lead that won't hurt adults can slow down normal mental and physical development of growing bodies. In addition, a child at play often comes into contact with sources of lead contamination -- like dirt and dust -- that rarely affect an adult. It is important to wash children's hands and toys often, and to try to make sure they only put food in their mouths.\n(C) Lead In Drinking Water\n1. Lead in drinking water, although rarely the sole cause of lead poisoning, can significantly increase a person's total lead exposure, particularly the exposure of infants who drink baby formulas and concentrated juices that are mixed with water. The EPA estimates that drinking water can make up 20 percent or more of a person's total exposure to lead.\n2. Lead is unusual among drinking water contaminants in that it seldom occurs naturally in water supplies like rivers and lakes. Lead enters drinking water primarily as a result of the corrosion, or wearing away, of materials containing lead in the water distribution system and household plumbing. These materials include lead-based solder used to join copper pipe, brass and chrome-plated brass faucets, and in some cases, pipes made of lead that connect houses and buildings to water mains (service lines). In 1986, Congress banned the use of lead solder containing greater than 0.2% lead, and restricted the lead content of faucets, pipes and other plumbing materials to 8.0%.\n3. When water stands in lead pipes or plumbing systems containing lead for several hours or more, the lead may dissolve into your drinking water. This means the first water drawn from the tap in the morning, or later in the afternoon if the water has not been used all day, can contain fairly high levels of lead.\n(D) Steps You Can Take. Steps you can take to reduce exposure to lead in drinking water include:\n1. Let the water run from the tap before using it for drinking or cooking any time the water in a faucet has gone unused for more than six hours. The longer water resides in plumbing the more lead it may contain. Flushing the tap means running the cold water faucet for about 15-30 seconds. Although toilet flushing or showering flushes water through a portion of the plumbing system, you still need to flush the water in each faucet before using it for drinking or cooking. Flushing tap water is a simple and inexpensive measure you can take to protect your health. It usually uses less than one gallon of water.\n2. Do not cook with, or drink water from the hot water tap. Hot water can dissolve more lead more quickly than cold water. If you need hot water, draw water from the cold tap and then heat it.\n3. The steps described above will reduce the lead concentrations in your drinking water. However, if you are still concerned, you may wish to use bottled water for drinking and cooking.\n4. You can consult a variety of sources for additional information. Your family doctor or pediatrician can perform a blood test for lead and provide you with information about the health effects of lead. State and local government agencies that can be contacted include:\nA. [insert the name or title of facility official if appropriate] at [insert phone number] can provide you with information about your facility's water supply; and\nB. [insert the name or title of the State Department of Health Services] at [insert phone number] or the [insert the name of the city or county health department] at [insert phone number] can provide you with information about the health effects of lead.\n(b) Any additional information presented shall be consistent with the information in subsection (a) and be in plain language that can be understood by laypersons. A system may delete information pertaining to lead service lines, on approval by the Department, if the water system does not have any such lines. Building permit record availability and consumer access to these records may be modified, if approved by the Department.\n(c) The system shall include the following information in all public service announcements submitted under its lead public education program to television and radio stations for broadcasting:\n(1) Why should everyone want to know the facts about lead and drinking water? Because unhealthy amounts of lead can enter drinking water through the plumbing in your home. That's why I urge you to do what I did. I had my water tested for [insert free or cost per sample]. You can contact the [insert the name of the city or water system] for information on testing and on simple ways to reduce your exposure to lead in drinking water.\n(2) To have your water tested for lead, or to get more information about this public health concern, please call [insert the phone number of the city or water system].\n(d) The system shall conduct the lead public education program as follows:\n(1) In communities where a significant proportion of the population speaks a language other than English, public education materials shall be communicated in the appropriate language(s).\n(2) Within 60 days after it has a lead action level exceedance, unless it is already conducting a lead public education program, a community water system shall:\n(A) Insert notices in each customer's water utility bill containing the information in paragraph (a)(1), along with the following alert on the water bill itself in large print: SOME HOMES IN THIS COMMUNITY HAVE ELEVATED LEAD LEVELS IN THEIR DRINKING WATER. LEAD CAN POSE A SIGNIFICANT RISK TO YOUR HEALTH. PLEASE READ THE ENCLOSED NOTICE FOR FURTHER INFORMATION. A community water system with a billing cycle that does not include a billing within 60 days of the exceedance, or that cannot insert information in the bill without making major changes to its billing system, may use a separate mailing as long as it is conducted within 60 days of the exceedance.\n(B) Submit the information in paragraph (a)(1) to the editorial departments of the major daily and weekly newspapers circulated throughout the community.\n(C) Deliver pamphlets and/or brochures that contain the public education materials in subparagraphs (a)(1)(B) and (D) to facilities and organizations, including the following:\n1. Public schools and/or local school boards;\n2. City or county health department;\n3. Women, Infants, and Children and/or Head Start Program(s) whenever available;\n4. Public and private hospitals and/or clinics;\n5. Pediatricians;\n6. Family planning clinics; and\n7. Local welfare agencies.\n(D) Submit the public service announcement in subsection (c) to at least five of the radio and television stations with the largest audiences that broadcast to the community served by the system.\n(3) A community system shall repeat the tasks in subparagraphs (d)(2)(A),(B) and (C) every 12 months, and the tasks in subparagraph (d)(2)(D) every 6 months for as long as the system has a lead action level exceedance.\n(4) Within 60 days after it has a lead action level exceedance, unless it is already conducting a lead public education program, a nontransient-noncommunity system shall deliver the public education materials in paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) as follows:\n(A) Post informational posters on lead in drinking water in a public place or common area in each of the buildings served by the system; and\n(B) Distribute informational pamphlets and/or brochures on lead in drinking water to each person served by the system. The Department may allow the system to utilize electronic transmission in lieu of or combined with printed materials as long as it achieves at least the same coverage.\n(5) A nontransient-noncommunity system shall repeat the tasks in paragraph (4) at least once during each calendar year in which the system has a lead action level exceedance.\n(6) A system may discontinue the lead public education program if it does not have a lead action level exceedance during the most recent period. The system shall recommence the program pursuant to this section if it subsequently has a lead action level exceedance.\n(7) A community water system may apply to the Department, in writing, to use the text in paragraph (a)(2) in lieu of the text in paragraph (a)(1) and to perform the tasks listed in paragraphs (d)(4) and (c)(5) of this section in lieu of the tasks in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section if:\n(A) The system is a facility, such as a prison or a hospital, where the population served is not capable of or is prevented from making improvements to plumbing or installing point of use treatment devices; and\n(B) The system provides water as part of the cost of services provided and does not separately charge for water consumption.\n(8) A community water system serving 3,300 or fewer people may omit the task contained in subparagraph (d)(2)(D). As long as it distributes notices containing the information contained in paragraph (a)(1) of this section to every household served by the system, such systems may further limit their public education programs as follows:\n(A) Systems serving 500 or fewer people may forego the task contained in subparagraph (d)(2)(B). Such a system may limit the distribution of the public education materials required under subparagraph (d)(2)(C) to facilities and organizations served by the system that are most likely to be visited regularly by pregnant women and children, unless notified by the Department in writing that it shall make a broader distribution.\n(B) If approved by the Department in writing, a system serving 501 to 3,300 people may omit the task in subparagraph (d)(2)(B) and/or limit the distribution of the public education materials required under subparagraph (d)(2)(C) to facilities and organizations served by the system that are most likely to be visited regularly by pregnant women and children.\n(9) A community water system serving 3,300 or fewer people that delivers the lead public education in accordance with paragraph (d)(8)(A) of this section shall repeat these requirements at least once during each calendar year in which the system exceeds the lead action level.\n"

When the system completes its installation of CCT, it shall submit a letter to the Department certifying that it has done so.\n(b) After the system installs CCT, the Department will review the treatment and pre- and post-treatment tap sampling and WQP monitoring data and specify WQPs in writing within 42 months of its CCT designation as follows:\n(1) A minimum value or a range of values for pH measured at each entry point to the distribution system;\n(2) A minimum pH value of 7.0 or greater, measured in all tap samples, unless the Department determines that meeting a pH level of 7.0 is not technologically feasible or is not necessary for the system to optimize corrosion control;\n(3) If a corrosion inhibitor is used, a minimum concentration or a range of concentrations for the inhibitor, measured at each entry point to the distribution system and in all tap samples, that the Department determines is necessary to maintain a passivating film on the interior walls of the pipes of the distribution system;\n(4) If alkalinity is adjusted as part of CCT, a minimum concentration or a range of concentrations for alkalinity, measured at each entry point to the distribution system and in all tap samples;\n(5) If calcium carbonate stabilization is used as part of corrosion control, a minimum concentration or a range of concentrations for calcium, measured in all tap samples; and\n(6) Values for additional WQPs determined by the Department to reflect CCT for the system.\n(c) After the Department specifies WQP values and ranges, each system shall monitor pursuant to section 64680 (General WQP Monitoring Requirements) and maintain WQPs as specified by the Department.\n(d) A system shall be out of compliance with the WQP values and ranges specified by the Department pursuant to subsection (b) for any period during which it has excursions for more than nine days.\n(1) An excursion occurs when a “daily value” at one or more sample sites for one or more WQPs in a day is below the minimum value or outside the range of Department-specified WQPs.\n(2) A “daily value” for a WQP at a site is determined as follows:\n(A) If sampling is more than once a day by continuous monitoring, grab sampling or both, the daily value shall be the average of all the day's results at the sampling site.\n(B) If sampling is once a day, the daily value shall be the day's result.\n(C) If sampling is less than once a day, the daily value shall apply to the day that the water supplier receives the result from the laboratory or the 30th day after the sample is collected, whichever comes first.\n(3) When an excursion occurs, within 48 hours of being notified of the results of the initial sample(s), the system shall investigate the cause and collect a followup sample at each affected site for each WQP that did not meet the Department-specified values. The criteria in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) shall be applied to the followup sample results to determine if another excursion has occurred.\n(e) A system conducting reduced WQP tap monitoring that fails to meet the Department-specified WQPs shall resume standard WQP tap monitoring pursuant to section 64680 (General WQP Monitoring Requirements).\n(f) The results of any monitoring conducted in addition to the minimum requirements of this section shall be considered by the system and submitted to the Department for making any determinations (i.e., determining concentrations of WQPs).\n(g) Upon its own initiative or in response to a request by a system, the Department may modify in writing its designation of CCT or its specified WQP values and ranges if it determines that modification is necessary to ensure that the system continues to maintain CCT. Any request shall be in writing, explain the reason for the requested modification, and include supporting documentation.\n"

  "paragraphText": "(a) A system shall replace lead service lines if:\n(1) It has a lead action level exceedance in tap samples after installing corrosion control and/or source water treatment (whichever sampling occurs later) and/or\n(2) It is in violation for failure to install source water treatment or CCT.\n(b) Within 6 months after it has a lead action level exceedance, the system shall demonstrate in writing that it has conducted a materials evaluation including that in section 64676 (Sample Site Selection) to identify the initial number of lead service lines in its distribution system, and shall submit both the demonstration and a schedule for complying with subsection (c) to the Department.\n(c) Except as provided in subsection (e), a system that is required to conduct lead service line replacement shall annually replace at least 7 percent of the initial number of lead service lines in its distribution system, pursuant to the following.\n(1) At the time the lead service line replacement begins, the system shall identify the initial number of lead service lines in its distribution system based on the evaluation in section 64676 (Sample Site Selection).\n(2) The first year of lead service line replacement shall begin on the date the system first had a lead action level exceedance subsequent to its installation of CCT and, if required pursuant to section 64686, source water treatment.\n(3) The system is not required to replace an individual lead service line if the lead concentration in each and every service line sample from that line, taken pursuant to the section 64687 (Lead Service Line Sampling), is less than or equal to 0.015 mg/L.\n(4) The system shall replace that portion of the lead service line that it owns and keep ownership documentation in its files and offer to replace the building owner's portion of the line with the cost being borne by the building owner. If the building owner does not accept the offer, the system shall:\n(A) At least 45 days prior to commencing the partial replacement, notify the resident(s) of all buildings served by the line that they may experience a temporary increase of lead levels in their drinking water, along with guidance on measures they may take to minimize their exposure. If the replacement is in conjunction with emergency repairs, the Department will allow a shorter notice, depending on the nature of the emergency and the timing involved. The notice shall be mailed unless an alternate method is approved by the Department, based on the feasibility of insuring that all consumers receive the notice; and\n(B) Inform the resident(s) that the system will collect a first flush tap water sample within 72 hours after the partial replacement of the service line has been completed if the resident(s) so desire. If the resident(s) accept the offer, the system shall collect the sample and report the results to the resident(s) and the owner within three business days of receiving the results and to the Department.\n(d) Within 12 months after the lead action level exceedance, and every 12 months thereafter, the system shall submit in writing to the Department the number of lead service lines scheduled to be replaced during the previous year of the system's replacement schedule, along with the following information to the Department:\n(1) The number and location of each lead service line replaced during the previous year of the system's replacement schedule to demonstrate that it has replaced at least 7 percent of the initial lead service lines within the previous 12 months, or a greater number of lines if required by the Department; or\n(2) Lead service line sampling results that demonstrate that the lead level from an individual line(s) is less than or equal to 0.015 mg/L, pursuant to section 64689 (Lead Service Line Sampling). The system shall submit the results of the lead service line sampling including the lead levels, location of each lead service line sampled, the sampling method, and the date of sampling. It shall also include the number and location of each lead service line replaced during the previous year. In such cases, the total number of lines replaced and/or that meet the criteria shall equal at least 7 percent of the initial number of lead lines identified or the percentage required by the Department.\n(e) A system shall replace lead service lines at a faster rate than that required by subsection (b), taking into account the number of lead service lines in the system, if the Department determines either that this is necessary based on elevated blood lead levels in the population served, or that it is feasible to complete the lead service line replacement program in a shorter time without increasing the water rates to the customers.\n(f) A system may cease replacing lead service lines when it has two consecutive periods without a lead action level exceedance. If the system has a lead action level exceedance during any subsequent period, it shall recommence replacing lead service lines.\n"

MDD shall be determined pursuant to subsection (b).\n(1) For systems with 1,000 or more service connections, the system shall be able to meet four hours of peak hourly demand (PHD) with source capacity, storage capacity, and/or emergency source connections.\n(2) For systems with less than 1,000 service connections, the system shall have storage capacity equal to or greater than MDD, unless the system can demonstrate that it has an additional source of supply or has an emergency source connection that can meet the MDD requirement.\n(3) Both the MDD and PHD requirements shall be met in the system as a whole and in each individual pressure zone.\n(b) A system shall estimate MDD and PHD for the water system as a whole (total source capacity and number of service connections) and for each pressure zone within the system (total water supply available from the water sources and interzonal transfers directly supplying the zone and number of service connections within the zone), as follows:\n(1) If daily water usage data are available, identify the day with the highest usage during the past ten years to obtain MDD; determine the average hourly flow during MDD and multiply by a peaking factor of at least 1.5 to obtain the PHD.\n(2) If no daily water usage data are available and monthly water usage data are available:\n(A) Identify the month with the highest water usage (maximum month) during at least the most recent ten years of operation or, if the system has been operating for less than ten years, during its period of operation;\n(B) To calculate average daily usage during maximum month, divide the total water usage during the maximum month by the number of days in that month; and\n(C) To calculate the MDD, multiply the average daily usage by a peaking factor that is a minimum of 1.5; and\n(D) To calculate the PHD, determine the average hourly flow during MDD and multiply by a peaking factor that is a minimum of 1.5.\n(3) If only annual water usage data are available:\n(A) Identify the year with the highest water usage during at least the most recent ten years of operation or, if the system has been operating for less than ten years, during its years of operation;\n(B) To calculate the average daily use, divide the total annual water usage for the year with the highest use by 365 days; and\n(C) To calculate the MDD, multiply the average daily usage by a peaking factor of 2.25.\n(D) To calculate the PHD, determine the average hourly flow during MDD and multiply by a peaking factor that is a minimum of 1.5.\n(4) If no water usage data are available, utilize records from a system that is similar in size, elevation, climate, demography, residential property size, and metering to determine the average water usage per service connection. From the average water usage per service connection, calculate the average daily demand and follow the steps in paragraph (3) to calculate the MDD and PHD.\n(c) Community water systems using only groundwater shall have a minimum of two approved sources before being granted an initial permit The system shall be capable of meeting MDD with the highest-capacity source off line.\n(d) A public water system shall determine the total capacity of its groundwater sources by summing the capacity of its individual active sources. \n(e) The capacity of a well shall be determined from pumping data existing prior to March 9, 2008 or in accordance with subsection (f) or (g). Prior to conducting a well capacity test pursuant to subsection (g), a system shall submit the information listed below to the State Board for review and approval.

Every four hours thereafter until the water drawdown level is constant for at least the last four remaining measurements, and;\n4. Plot the drawdown and pump discharge rate data versus time data on semi-logarithmic graph paper, with the time intervals on the horizontal logarithmic axis and the drawdown and pump discharge rate data on the vertical axis.\n(B) Procedures for a 10 day well capacity test:\n1. For the purpose of obtaining an accurate static water level value, at least twelve hours before initiating step 2., pump the well at the pump discharge rate proposed in subsection (e)(2) for no more than two hours, then discontinue pumping;\n2. Measure and record the static water level and then pump the well continuously for a minimum of 10 days starting at the pump discharge rate proposed in (e)(2);\n3.

If the well recovery does not meet these criteria, the well capacity cannot be determined pursuant to subsection (g)(2) using the proposed pump rate. To demonstrate meeting the recovery criteria, the following water level data in the well shall be measured, recorded, and compared with the criteria:\n1. Every 30 minutes during the first four hours after pumping stops,\n2. Hourly for the next eight hours, and\n3. Every 12 hours until either the water level in the well recovers to within two feet of the static water level measured at the beginning of the well capacity test or to a at least ninety-five percent of the total drawdown measured during the test, which ever occurs first.\n(D) Following completion of a 72-hour or 10-day well capacity test, the well shall be assigned a capacity no more than:\n1.
