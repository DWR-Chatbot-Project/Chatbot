1,TTHMs [Total Trihalomethanes],"Some people who drink water containing trihalomethanes in excess of the MCL over many years may experience liver, kidney, or central nervous system problems, and may have an increased risk of getting cancer."
2,Haloacetic Acids,Some people who drink water containing halocetic acids in excess of the MCL over many years may have an increased risk of getting cancer.
3,Bromate,Some people who drink water containing bromate in excess of the MCL over many years may have an increased risk of getting cancer.
4,Chloramines,Some people who use water containing chloramines well in excess of the MRDL could experience irritating effects to their eyes and nose.  Some people who drink water containing chloramines well in excess of the MRDL could experience stomach discomfort or anemia.
5,Chlorine,Some people who use water containing chlorine well in excess of the MRDL could experience irritating effects to their eyes and nose.  Some people who drink water containing chlorine well in excess of the MRDL could experience stomach discomfort.
6,Chlorite,Some infants and young children who drink water containing chlorite in excess of the MCL could experience nervous system effects.  Similar effects may occur in fetuses of pregnant women who drink water containing chlorite in excess of the MCL.  Some people may experience anemia.
7,Chlorine dioxide (2 consecutive daily samples at the entry point to the distribution system that are greater than the MRDL),"Some infants and young children who drink water containing chlorine dioxide in excess of the MRDL could experience nervous system effects.  Similar effects may occur in fetuses of pregnant women who drink water containing chlorine dioxide in excess of the MRDL.  Some people may experience anemia.
Add for public notification only:  The chlorine dioxide violations reported today are the result of exceedances at the treatment facility only, not within the distribution system that delivers water to consumers.  Continued compliance with chlorine dioxide levels within the distribution system minimizes the potential risk of these violations to consumers."
8,"Chlorine dioxide (one or more distribution system samples are above the MRDL)
","Some infants and young children who drink water containing chlorine dioxide in excess of the MRDL could experience nervous system effects.  Similar effects may occur in fetuses of pregnant women who drink water containing chlorine dioxide in excess of the MRDL.  Some people may experience anemia.
Add for public notification only:  The chlorine dioxide violations reported today include exceedances of the State standard within the distribution system that delivers water to consumers.  These violations may harm human health based on short-term exposures.  Certain groups, including fetuses, infants, and young children, may be especially susceptible to nervous system effects from excessive chlorine dioxide exposure."
9,Control of DBP precursors (TOC),"Total organic carbon (TOC) has no health effects.  However, total organic carbon provides a medium for the formation of disinfection byproducts.  These byproducts include trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs).  Drinking water containing these byproducts in excess of the MCL may lead to adverse health effects, liver or kidney problems, or nervous system effects, and may lead to an increased risk of getting cancer."
