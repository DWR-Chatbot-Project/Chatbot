11,Fluoride,"For the Consumer Confidence Report:  Some people who drink water containing fluoride in excess of the federal MCL of 4 mg/L over many years may get bone disease, including pain and tenderness of the bones. Children who drink water containing fluoride in excess of the state MCL of 2 mg/L may get mottled teeth.
For a Public Notice:   This is an alert about your drinking water and a cosmetic dental problem that might affect children under nine years of age.  At low levels, fluoride can help prevent cavities, but children drinking water containing more than 2 milligrams per liter (mg/L) of fluoride may develop cosmetic discoloration of their permanent teeth (dental fluorosis).  The drinking water provided by your community water system [name] has a fluoride concentration of [insert value] mg/L.
Dental fluorosis may result in a brown staining and/or pitting of the permanent teeth.  This problem occurs only in developing teeth, before they erupt from the gums.  Children under nine should be provided with alternative sources of drinking water or water that has been treated to remove the fluoride to avoid the possibility of staining and pitting of their permanent teeth.  You may also want to contact your dentist about proper use by young children of fluoride-containing products.  Older children and adults may safely drink the water.
Drinking water containing more than 4 mg/L of fluoride can increase your risk of developing bone disease.
For more information, please call [water system contact name] of [water system name] at [phone number].  Some home water treatment units are also available to remove fluoride from drinking water.  To learn more about available home water treatment units, you may call the State Board’s Residential Water Treatment Device Registration Unit at (916) 449-5600."
