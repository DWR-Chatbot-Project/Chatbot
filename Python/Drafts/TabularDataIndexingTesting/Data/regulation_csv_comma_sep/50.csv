1,"E. coli are bacteria whose presence indicates that the water may be contaminated with human or animal wastes.  Human pathogens in these wastes can cause short-term effects, such as diarrhea, cramps, nausea, headaches, or other symptoms.  They may pose a greater health risk for infants, young children, the elderly, and people with severely compromised immune systems.  We found E. coli bacteria, indicating the need to look for potential problems in water treatment or distribution.  When this occurs, we are required to conduct assessment(s) to identify problems and to correct any problems that were found during these assessments.

We were required to complete a Level 2 assessment because we found E. coli in our water system.  In addition, we were required to take [INSERT NUMBER OF CORRECTIVE ACTIONS] corrective actions and we completed [INSERT NUMBER OF CORRECTIVE ACTIONS] of these actions.

If a water system failed to complete the required assessment or correct all identified sanitary defects, the water system is in violation of the treatment technique requirement and shall include the following statements, as appropriate:

We failed to conduct the required assessment.

We failed to correct all sanitary defects that were identified during the assessment."
