1,E. coli ,"E. coli are bacteria whose presence indicates that the water may be contaminated with human or animal wastes.  Human pathogens in these wastes can cause short-term effects, such as diarrhea, cramps, nausea, headaches, or other symptoms.  They may pose a greater health risk for infants, young children, the elderly, and people with severely-compromised immune systems."
2,Coliform Assessment and/or Corrective Action Violations,"Coliforms are bacteria that are naturally present in the environment and are used as an indicator that other, potentially harmful, waterborne pathogens may be present or that a potential pathway exists through which contamination may enter the drinking water distribution system.  We found coliforms indicating the need to look for potential problems in water treatment or distribution.  When this occurs, we are required to conduct assessment(s) to identify problems and to correct any problems that were found.

For a public notice, the water system shall use the following applicable sentences:

We failed to conduct the required assessment.

We failed to correct all identified sanitary defects that were found during the assessment(s)."
3,"E. coli Assessment and/or Corrective Action Violations
","E. coli are bacteria whose presence indicates that the water may be contaminated with human or animal wastes.  Human pathogens in these wastes can cause short-term effects, such as diarrhea, cramps, nausea, headaches, or other symptoms. They may pose a greater health risk for infants, young children, the elderly, and people with severely compromised immune systems.  We violated the standard for E. coli, indicating the need to look for potential problems in water treatment or distribution.  When this occurs, we are required to conduct a detailed assessment to identify problems and to correct any problems that are found.

For a public notice, the water system shall use the following applicable sentences: 

We failed to conduct the required assessment.

We failed to correct all identified sanitary defects that were found during the assessment."
4,Seasonal System Treatment Technique Violations,"When this violation includes the failure to monitor for total coliforms or E. coli prior to serving water to the public, the mandatory language found at section 64465(a)(11) shall be used.

When the violation includes failure to complete other actions, the appropriate elements found in sections 64465(a)(1) through (10) to describe the violation shall be used."
5,Turbidity,"Turbidity has no health effects. However, high levels of turbidity can interfere with disinfection and provide a medium for microbial growth. Turbidity may indicate the presence of disease-causing organisms. These organisms include bacteria, viruses, and parasites that can cause symptoms such as nausea, cramps, diarrhea, and associated headaches."
