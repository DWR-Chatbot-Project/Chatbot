2,Fecal Coliform,"Fecal coliforms are bacteria whose presence indicates that the water may be contaminated with human or animal wastes.  Microbes in these wastes can cause short-term effects, such as diarrhea, cramps, nausea, headaches, or other symptoms.  They may pose a special health risk for infants, young children, some of the elderly, and people with severely compromised immune systems."
